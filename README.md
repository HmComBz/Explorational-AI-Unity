# Explorational-AI-Unity
The target is do develop a self learning, self exploring agent in Unity and see how it interacts with other agents in a non deterministic, multi agent environment. The plan is to create a couple of parameters that mimics the simple reward functions of a human and see if it is possible, without telling the agent to do so, to get the agent to cooperate with other agents.

Requirements:
-----------------------------
- Unity (v2020.3.19f1)
- ML-agents (Unity Add-in)
- Python 3.7.6
- CUDA 10.2
- CuDNN 7.6

Hardware:
-----------------------------
CPU: Intel Core i9-9900k
GPU: Nvidia GTX 1080 8 GB
Memory: 32 GB
