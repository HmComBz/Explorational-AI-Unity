# Explorational-AI-Unity
The target is do develop a self learning, self exploring agent in Unity and see how it interacts with other agents in a multi agent environment. The plan is to create a couple of parameters that mimics the simple reward functions of a human and see if it is possible, without telling the agent to do so, to get the agent to cooperate with other agents.
